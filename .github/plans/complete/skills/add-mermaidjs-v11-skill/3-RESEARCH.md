# Research: add-mermaidjs-v11-skill

## Context

- Goal: Add the upstream mermaidjs-v11 skill into this repo, align with local skill conventions, and update installer/docs.
- Stakeholders: Vibe Flow maintainers, downstream repo users installing skills.
- Audience: Orchestrator + future implementer.

## Codebase Analysis

### Key files inspected

- [install-vibeflow.md](install-vibeflow.md)
- [.github/agents/vibe-flow.agent.md](.github/agents/vibe-flow.agent.md)
- [.github/skills/orchestration/SKILL.md](.github/skills/orchestration/SKILL.md)
- [.github/skills/research/SKILL.md](.github/skills/research/SKILL.md)
- [docs/vibeflow/research-skill.md](docs/vibeflow/research-skill.md)
- [1-OVERVIEW.md](.github/plans/in-progress/skills/add-mermaidjs-v11-skill/1-OVERVIEW.md)

### Architectural notes

- Skills are stored under .github/skills/<skill-name>/ with a required SKILL.md and optional references/, scripts/, assets/.
- The orchestrator enumerates skills in the <available_skills> section of [vibe-flow.agent.md](.github/agents/vibe-flow.agent.md).
- The installer (see [install-vibeflow.md](install-vibeflow.md)) explicitly fetches skill files and verifies expected skill paths. It also documents a skills-manifest.json convention, though this repo does not yet include one.
- Documentation currently mentions only the research skill in [docs/vibeflow/research-skill.md](docs/vibeflow/research-skill.md); README does not list skills.

### Hotspots / risk areas

- External skill licensing is unclear (no LICENSE found in upstream repo).
- The skill includes references with CLI guidance that depends on Node.js >=18.19 and the @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli package; this is documentation-only but may imply runtime expectations for users.
- Installer updates must include all new files to avoid partial installs.

## External Discovery

### Links & evidence

- Upstream skill: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/SKILL.md
- Reference files:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/references/diagram-types.md
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/references/configuration.md
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/references/cli-usage.md
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/references/integration.md
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrgoonie/claudekit-skills/main/.claude/skills/mermaidjs-v11/references/examples.md

## Alternatives

- Option A: Vendor the upstream skill verbatim (SKILL.md + references). Pros: complete, proven structure. Cons: larger footprint; license must be clarified.
- Option B: Write a slim in-house SKILL.md that points to Mermaid docs instead of bundling references. Pros: smaller repo size; less maintenance. Cons: lower offline utility; loses curated examples.
- Option C: Create a merged/curated skill that only includes the most-used references. Pros: tailored; smaller. Cons: more curation work; diverges from upstream.

## Recommendation

- Recommendation: Option A (vendor upstream skill verbatim), then update installer and skill metadata.
- Rationale: fastest path, preserves upstream examples, and aligns with the skill package model (SKILL.md + references/). Confirm license before publishing if required.

## Evidence & Artifacts

- Upstream SKILL.md frontmatter and structure verified via curl (frontmatter present at top).
- CLI requirements noted in references/cli-usage.md (Node.js ^18.19 || >=20.0).
