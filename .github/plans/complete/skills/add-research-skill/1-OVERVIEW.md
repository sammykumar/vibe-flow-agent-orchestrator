# Overview: Research Skill

**Goal:** Build a specialized `research` skill to power the Research phase in the Vibe Flow orchestrator.

**Scope:**

- Author `SKILL.md` for `.github/skills/research/` that follows the agentskills.io specification.
- Define required `tools`, `templates`, `validation`, and packaging steps so the skill can be installed via `install-vibeflow.md`.
- Deliverables: `3-RESEARCH.md`, `4-SPEC.md`, `5-PLAN.md`, updated `install-vibeflow.md` entries, and unit/integration tests for skill packaging.

**Context & Links:**

- Agentskills spec: https://agentskills.io/specification
