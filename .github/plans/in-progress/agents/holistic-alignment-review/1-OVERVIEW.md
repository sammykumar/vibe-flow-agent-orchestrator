# Overview

## Goal

Review the Vibe Flow repository holistically (excluding v1 backups) to verify alignment across orchestrator, research agent, and implement agent after recent changes. Provide recommended adjustments if gaps are found.

## Scope

- Start at docs/vibeflow/orchestrator-manual.md
- Review all relevant repo files except any v1 content
- Validate alignment with current incremental mode (vibe-flow, research agent, implement agent)

## Success Criteria

- Clear list of any misalignments or outdated statements
- Concrete recommendations for changes (if needed)
- Evidence-backed findings referenced in research output
