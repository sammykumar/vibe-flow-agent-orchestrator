# Research: update-readme-mermaid-v2

## Context

- Goal: Specify Mermaid diagram updates in README to reflect V2 incremental mode (research + implement subagents installed).
- Stakeholders: Vibe Flow maintainers, users installing the agent suite.
- Audience: README readers evaluating the workflow and installed agents.

## Codebase Analysis

### Key files inspected

- README.md (workflow diagram and README narrative)
- .github/agents/vibe-flow.agent.md (current V2 orchestrator behavior and installed subagents)
- .github/agents/research.agent.md (installed subagent)
- .github/agents/implement.agent.md (installed subagent)
- .github/prompts/new-feature.prompt.md and .github/prompts/update-feature.prompt.md (entry prompts referenced in diagram)

### Architectural notes

- V2 incremental mode installs `research-agent` and `implement-agent` only. Test/document are explicitly not installed in the orchestrator instructions.
- The README Mermaid diagram currently shows only `research-agent` and a “Stop after Research” note, which is inconsistent with the current agent roster.
- Prompts `new-feature` and `update-feature` are still entry points into `vibe-flow` and should remain in the diagram.

### Hotspots / risk areas

- Diagram should avoid implying test/document phases are installed.
- Diagram should show that `implement-agent` is delegated after research and is part of the workflow before the stop point.

## External Discovery

### Links & evidence

- No external references required. Evidence is from repository agent definitions and README.

## Alternatives

- Option A: Update diagram to include `implement-agent` and update “Stop after Research” to “Stop after Implement” with no future-phase placeholders.
- Option B: Update diagram to include `implement-agent` and add a dashed “Future (Not Installed)” node group for `test-agent` and `document-agent`.

## Recommendation

- Recommendation: Option A.
- Rationale: The request is to reflect current V2 state and subagents. Keeping the diagram focused on installed agents reduces ambiguity. Future phases are already described textually elsewhere in the README.

## Evidence & Artifacts

- README diagram shows only `research-agent` and stop after research.
- Orchestrator definition lists installed subagents: `research-agent`, `implement-agent`.
