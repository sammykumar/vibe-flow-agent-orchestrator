# Plan: update-readme-mermaid-v2

## Tasks

- [x] Update README Mermaid diagram to include `implement-agent` and delegation step after research.
- [x] Replace `docs/*.md` node with `repo changes` node and update stop annotation to “Stop after Implement”.
- [x] Add Mermaid styling for `implement-agent` node to match V2 state.
- [x] Verify diagram block matches the exact spec in `4-SPEC.md` and no other README sections are changed.

## Notes

- No runtime tests required; documentation-only change.
