# Spec: rename-5-plans

## Overview

- Purpose: Migrate legacy plan folders that still use 5-PLAN.md to the standardized 5-TASKS.md filename.
- Goals & success criteria:
  - All 5-PLAN.md files under .github/plans/\*\* are renamed to 5-TASKS.md.
  - No file contents are modified during the rename.
  - Only plan-folder files are affected.

## Design

- Architecture: One-time repository migration of file names within .github/plans/\*\*.
- APIs & interfaces: Not applicable (file-system rename only).

## Constraints

- Security, permissions, and scope:
  - Changes are limited to .github/plans/\*\*.
  - Do not edit historical content beyond renaming the file.
  - Avoid touching non-plan files or other directories.

## Acceptance Criteria

- No remaining 5-PLAN.md files exist under .github/plans/\*\*.
- Each previously identified 5-PLAN.md is now 5-TASKS.md in the same folder.
- File contents are unchanged (rename-only).
- Git status shows only file renames within .github/plans/\*\*.

## Deliverables

- 3-RESEARCH.md and 4-SPEC.md in the active plan directory.
- Renamed files (5-PLAN.md → 5-TASKS.md) for the following plan folders:
  - .github/plans/in-progress/agents/plan-writer-subagent/
  - .github/plans/complete/versioning/script-fix/
  - .github/plans/complete/agents/parallel-subagents/
  - .github/plans/complete/skills/add-mermaidjs-v11-skill/
  - .github/plans/complete/agents/parallel-subagents-visualization/
  - .github/plans/complete/doc-updates/update-readme-mermaid-v2/
  - .github/plans/complete/agents/holistic-alignment-review/
  - .github/plans/complete/skills/add-research-skill/
