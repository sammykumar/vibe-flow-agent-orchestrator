# Research: Create `research` Skill

**Scope:** Research agent: review the Agentskills specification at https://agentskills.io/specification and the existing file `.github/agents/research.agent.md` in this repository. Produce a detailed research output that includes:

- Existing Patterns: mappings from `research.agent.md` to skill fields
- Required SKILL fields and recommended values
- Tools list (strict and optional), rationale and permission scopes
- Templates and assets to include under `.github/skills/research/`
- Packaging and install steps to update `install-vibeflow.md`
- Test & verification plan (unit/integration for the skill package)
- Alternative approaches and recommendation

Please write findings here with evidence (file paths, snippets, and URLs). Capture any sample `SKILL.md` fragments and a proposed directory layout.
