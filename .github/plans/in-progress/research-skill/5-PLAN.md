# Plan: Implement `research` Skill

Use this plan to break down implementation tasks once research and spec are complete. Suggested steps:

- [x] Create `.github/skills/research/SKILL.md` and required assets
- [x] Add templates and examples under `.github/skills/research/assets/`
- [x] Add packaging scripts and validation tests
- [x] Update `install-vibeflow.md` to install the new skill
- [x] Add tests and CI to validate skill installation and basic behaviors

(Adjust tasks after `4-SPEC.md` is authored.)
