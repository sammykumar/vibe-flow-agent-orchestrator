# Plan: Implement `research` Skill

Use this plan to break down implementation tasks once research and spec are complete. Suggested steps:

1. Create `.github/skills/research/SKILL.md` and required assets
2. Add templates and examples under `.github/skills/research/assets/`
3. Add packaging scripts and validation tests
4. Update `install-vibeflow.md` to install the new skill
5. Add tests and CI to validate skill installation and basic behaviors

(Adjust tasks after `4-SPEC.md` is authored.)
