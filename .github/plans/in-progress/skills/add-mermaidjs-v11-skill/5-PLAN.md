# Plan: add-mermaidjs-v11-skill

## Implementation Tasks

1. Add skill files
   - Create .github/skills/mermaidjs-v11/ and references/.
   - Copy upstream SKILL.md and reference files verbatim.
   - Verify frontmatter is intact and references paths match.

2. Update installer
   - In [install-vibeflow.md](install-vibeflow.md), add fetch steps for mermaidjs-v11 files under Step 7.2.
   - Add mermaidjs-v11 to the Step 7.3 verification list.

3. Update skill discovery metadata
   - Add mermaidjs-v11 entry to <available_skills> in [vibe-flow.agent.md](.github/agents/vibe-flow.agent.md).
   - If adopting a manifest, add entry in .github/skills/skills-manifest.json (decide with maintainers).

4. Documentation update
   - Update README to list mermaidjs-v11 under a “Skills Included” section OR add a docs/vibeflow/mermaidjs-v11-skill.md entry and link it from README.

5. Validation
   - Confirm file paths exist and align with installer steps.
   - Spot-check links and references in the new skill for correctness.

## Sequencing Notes

- Tasks 1–3 must land before documentation updates to avoid broken links.
- Validate installer changes after file copy to prevent missing paths.
