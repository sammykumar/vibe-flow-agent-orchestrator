# Research Skill

The `research` skill performs repository research and scaffolds the PDD artifacts
for a plan:

- `3-RESEARCH.md` — findings, alternatives, and evidence
- `4-SPEC.md` — technical specification and acceptance criteria
- `5-PLAN.md` — implementation plan and task checklist
- `2-PROGRESS.md` — progress updates

Quickstart

- Install Vibe Flow (see `install-vibeflow.md`)
- Verify the skill by running:

```bash
bash .github/skills/research/scripts/validate-skill.sh
```

Run the integration dry-run locally:

```bash
bash .github/skills/research/tests/integration/dry-run/run.sh
```
